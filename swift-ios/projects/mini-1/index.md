Applying what you've learned about StoryBoards and Actions & Outlets, you are going to build a little "About Me" app! This gives you both a chance to practice your skills, as well as get to know your fellow scholars! Over the course of camp, we'll share these with each other!

### Must-Haves

- Your name
- An image of something that represents you and your passions
- A button that reveals some facts about you
- Use of color

### Tips

Have fun! We ask that you spend about 30 minutes on this.

## Iteration 1 - Rough Draft

In your notebook, first jot down what information you want to share on your About Me app. Draft that all up, so when it's time to set up the StoryBoard, you don't have to think of what that content will be.

## Iteration 2 - Objects

Get all the objects you need from the Object Library, and lay them out as desired.

## Iteration 3 - Constraints & Color

Add constraints so your app looks great on all device sizes. Add any color you'd like!
