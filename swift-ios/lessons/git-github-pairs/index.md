## Purpose

You will likely collaborate with another scholar on your final project. This document will outline how to get set up to work on the same project, and give you guidelines for what your workflow should look like once you're set up.

Each step listed below will pertain to one partner or the other. The emojis are used in the step titles to make it as clear as possible.

## ðŸ’–ðŸ”®Step 0: Connect Xcode to GitHub

Both partners must complete steps 1-2 of the [Git & GitHub walk-thru]() before continuing. It is likely that you've already done this!

## ðŸ’–Step 1: Create Project

Partner A should follow steps 3-7 in the [Git & GitHub walk-thru](). For step 5, they don't need to build the entire project; just take the first step in building the project.

Send the URL of the GitHub repository to Partner B in Slack.

## ðŸ”®Step 2: Open the Project in Xcode

Partner B should open the GitHub link they got in Slack.

Click the green "Clone or download" button on the right side of the page.

Click "Accept Invitation".

### You're All Set Up!

Both Partners A and B can contribute to this project. Because both partners are able to make changes, this opens the doors for potential challenges. Read the next section and follow the procedures very carefully to avoid those challenges.
