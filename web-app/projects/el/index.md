title: Estée Lauder Zen Garden CONTEST
---

[Back to Projects]({{ site.url }}/web-app/projects)

Estée Lauder is looking to YOU to design and build a Karlie Kloss feature piece for their site. Here are the parameters:
- Start with the CSS Zen Garden starter kit. _What is a CSS Zen Garden?_ It's a demonstration of what can be accomplished with CSS. You will be given HTML to use, and cannot change it at all. The exceptions to that rule are, you can add classes or IDs to elements and you can change the `src` attribute for `video` and `img` tags! Then, you'll write CSS to make the page your own. [Find the CSS Zen Garden project that inspired the challenge in this contest here](http://www.csszengarden.com/)! The magical thing about Zen Gardens is that everyone will start with the exact same CSS, but end with a totally different outcome!
- Decide on a color palette. Here are a few great resources:
  - [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/)
  - [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
  - [Color Picker](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)

- Decide on which photo assets you will use from the options provided [here](https://bit.ly/kwk-el-assets ). [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JfVwxF260k) will walk you through how to use the assets folder in your Glitch project.
- Think carefully about the design decisions you make. You'll be asked to share your rationale for those decision by reflecting on these questions list questions that will be on submission.
  - Question 1
  - Question 2
