Estēe Lauder is looking to YOU to design and build a Karlie Kloss feature piece for their site. Here are the parameters:
- Choose one of the two CSS Zen Gardens starter kits to work with. What is a CSS Zen Garden? It's a demonstration of what can be accomplished with CSS. You will be given HTML to use, and cannot change it at all. The ONLY exception to that rule is, you can add classes or IDs to elements. Then, you'll write CSS to make the page your own. [Find the CSS Zen Garden project that inspired the challenge in this contest here](http://www.csszengarden.com/)!
