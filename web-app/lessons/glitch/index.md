## What is Glitch?


## Glitch Projects

Glitch projects allow us to write all the code in one place AND see our code come to life with a real URL. Watch [this video](https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cYfIbXaNvf), or read each section below to learn a little about how we will use Glitch projects at camp this summer.

### Viewing an embedded project in a lesson

Some lessons have embedded Glitch projects. They usually show to App. To view the Source Code, click the button in the bottom right corner. Once you are viewing the code, you can select each file and view its contents. To move back to viewing the App, click View App in the bottom right corner.

### Editing a project embedded in a lesson

Once viewing the Source Code of an embedded Glitch project, click the Edit Project button the top right corner. Then, you can edit to code in the embedded project. Immediately after changing the code, the results will appear in the App!

### Remixing a project linked in a lesson

When your instructor gives you a starter project, you'll first need to Remix it before you can build on that code.

From a project page, click Remis to Edit in the top right corner. This will make a copy of the project on your account.
