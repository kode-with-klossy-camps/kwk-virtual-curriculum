## Comp Recreations

The best way to practice anything with CSS is to re-create comps! Choose one of the two comps below, and work to re-create it.

So you can spend the bulk of you time implementing Flexbox, we've created a starter Glitch project for each. With that being said, you still may decide to change the HTML a bit so you can containers that allow you to control the layout with Flexbox.
